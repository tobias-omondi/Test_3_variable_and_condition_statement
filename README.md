## Practice Your JavaScript: Variables and Conditionals

This document provides four practice questions to help you solidify your understanding of variables and conditional statements (if, else if, else) in JavaScript. Each question focuses on using these concepts in different scenarios.

**What you'll learn:**

* Assigning values to variables.
* Utilizing conditional statements for branching logic.
* Combining `if`, `else if`, and `else` for complex decisions.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a new JavaScript file for each question.
2. Write code to address the specific problem statement.
3. Test your code with various inputs to ensure it works as expected.
4. Feel free to experiment and modify the questions to further challenge yourself.

**Questions:**

1. **Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion with Freezing Point Check:**
   Convert a Celsius temperature provided by the user to Fahrenheit, considering the freezing point (0°C or 32°F).

   Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion with Freezing Point Check:

   * Ask the user for a temperature in Celsius using prompt().
   * Store the temperature in a variable (celsiusTemp).
   * Use an if statement to check if the Celsius temperature is below 0:
   * If it is (celsiusTemp < 0), calculate the equivalent Fahrenheit temperature using the * * * formula (celsiusTemp * 9/5) + 32 and store it in a variable (fahrenheitTemp).
    *  Print a message like "The temperature is <freezingPointInFahrenheit> Fahrenheit (Freezing point)." (Replace <freezingPointInFahrenheit> with the calculated value


2. **Number Sign Detector:**
   Determine and print whether a user-entered number is positive, negative, or zero.
3. **Grading System with Letter Grade and Descriptive Message:**
   Based on a user's numerical grade, assign a letter grade (A-F) and provide a corresponding descriptive message (e.g., "Excellent work!" for A).
4. **Movie Ticket Discount (Simplified):**
   Calculate the total price for movie tickets considering age-based discounts (senior, child) and user-provided quantities.

**Tips:**

* Use comments to explain your code's logic for better readability.
* Test your code with both valid and invalid inputs to handle edge cases.
* Research additional JavaScript concepts like data types and mathematical operations to enhance your solutions.

By working through these questions, you'll gain valuable practice in manipulating variables and making decisions using conditional statements, solidifying your foundation in core JavaScript concepts.
